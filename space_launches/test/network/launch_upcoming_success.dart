which was started in the mid 1990ies to develop a successor for the Komtea class of area surveillance satellites. The original Bars project was halted in the early 2000s. In 2007, TsSKB-Progress was contracted for Bars-M, for which reportedly the Yantar-based service module was replaced by a new developed advanced service module.\n\nThe Bars-M satellites feature an electro-optical camera system called Karat, which is developed and built by the Leningrad Optical Mechanical Association (LOMO), and a dual laser altimeter instrument to deliver topographic imagery, stereo images, altimeter data and high-resolution images with a ground resolution around 1 meter.","launch_designator":null,"type":"Government/Top Secret","orbit":{"id":17,"name":"Sun-Synchronous Orbit","abbrev":"SSO"}},"pad":{"id":85,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/pad/85/?format=json","agency_id":163,"name":"43/4 (43R)","info_url":null,"wiki_url":"","map_url":"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=62.929+N,+40.457+E","latitude":"62.92883","longitude":"40.457098","location":{"id":6,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/6/?format=json","name":"Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russian Federation","country_code":"RUS","map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_6_20200803142434.jpg","total_launch_count":72,"total_landing_count":0},"map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_85_20200803143554.jpg","total_launch_count":38},"webcast_live":false,"image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/soyuz_2.1a_image_20201013143850.jpg","infographic":null,"program":[]}]}
